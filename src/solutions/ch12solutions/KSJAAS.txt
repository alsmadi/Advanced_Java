You need to change the login config file to specify 
com.sun.security.auth.module.KeyStoreLoginModule.

You also need to create a policy file for the application.  Because we're only
looking at the Subject, and not calling doAs(), you don't need a separate policy 
entry specifying the principal.  Because of that, the all.policy file in the
chapter directory will do the job.

Normally, that's all you would have to do.  But since NTJAAS doesn't use a 
callback handler, you need to edit the source code to pass a LoginHandler to the 
LoginContext constructor.
