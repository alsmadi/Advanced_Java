When you run ShowTimeClient, TimeServer has an exception:
Exception in thread "RMI TCP Connection(2)-10.0.0.1" java.security.AccessControl
Exception: access denied (java.net.SocketPermission 10.0.0.1:1121 accept,resolve
)

The exception tells you TimeServer needs a SocketPermission with accept and 
resolve actions.

After adding the accept permission, your .java.policy file should look something like
this:

grant codeBase "file:///C:/advj2se/ch09/-" {
  permission java.net.SocketPermission "*:*", "connect, resolve, accept";
  permission java.io.FilePermission "C:\\advj2se\\ch09\\server\\-", "read";
  permission java.io.FilePermission "C:\\advj2se\\ch09\\*", "write";
  permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "exitVM";
};


Or something like it, depending upon your setup.
